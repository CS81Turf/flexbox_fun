This is the start of a work information board I want to make for my current job. It's a lawn care company, where we spray and fertilize lawns. Currently I'm just working on the layout of the webpage that will be displayed on a TV as everyone walks in the office. I'm choosing this project to help with the communicaton at work. It will eventually involve fetching API's for weather information and a way for key personnel to edit notes on it and have it update every so often. 

Features:
-Shows the current time/date and weather
-Shows a 3-5 day forecast of weather
-Displays important notes pertaining to work related matters
-Tracks our current numbers and if we're on pace to meet our goals
